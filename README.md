# hapPyWorld-scatterplots

Thank you for your interest in my work! For our first project in my data analytics bootcamp at Georgia Tech, my team looked into the Happiness Report data to try and uncover trends and tell a story about what factors lead to or result from "happiness". 

We used data from 2015-2019's World Happiness Report (https://worldhappiness.report/). I created five different scatter plots from each yearly report in order to see how five factors used within the report(GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity and perception of corruption scores) correlated with the overall happiness.
